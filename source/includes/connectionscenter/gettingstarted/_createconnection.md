## Creating a Connection
The following instructions will be using credentials for a testing account. You will need to obtain credentials from the data owner before you set up your production connection.
Before you can start using the Connections Center web services, you need to setup a connection and group. To do this, go to your Tirewire account and click on Connections Center.

You probably won't have any connections to begin with so you'll want to create a new connection by clicking on the link.

Enter a name for your connection (this is just a testing connection so the name is not important), click the Tireweb logo and enter the following credentials (leave Biller Code blank):

<table>
<tr><td>Username</td><td>test1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>test1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key</td><td>CL107US6</td></tr>
</table>

Click create connection and the following dialog box will show up:

Data owners have control of where the information you pull indirectly from them can be displayed. As this is just a test connection this is not important for now, but it may be for future connections depending on your intended use. So, for now we can just press OK here without selecting anything.

Press OK again when the above dialog shows up.

The message down the bottom of the screen about the credit card can be ignored, as this is just a test connection.
