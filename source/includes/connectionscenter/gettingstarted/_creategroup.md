## Creating a Group
Now that a connection has been created, the next step is to create a group. Groups are important in categorizing connections and are required to use the Connections Center web services.

To create a group, the first thing to do is navigate to the Connections Center and click on New Group:

Here, enter a name for your group and click OK. This is just for testing so the name is not important.

The next step is to drag your connection into the group. Group's are capable of having multiple connections and connections can be in multiple groups. A scenario where groups are helpful is if you were using the connections center to pull data into your online store as well as your point of sale system. If you have 3 connections and want to use them all in your point of sale but only one in your online store, you would create an "online store" group and a "point of sale" group and then setup your other systems to pull connection data from their corresponding group.

Now that we have a group setup, we can retrieve the group token to use in web services. To do this, click the dropdown and select Get Token:

Your token will appear in the next dialog. You are now ready to use the Connections Center web services.
